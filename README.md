# ⚛️ **QHub Learning Platform — Quantum Hub Perú**

**The future is not deterministic — it’s quantum.**

Welcome to the QHub Learning Platform, an interactive learning environment created by Quantum Hub Perú to make quantum computing education accessible, visual, and intuitive for students across Peru and Latin America.

The platform is designed for high school learners and early-year university students, enabling them to explore quantum concepts through animations, guided interactions, and hands-on simulations — no prior background required.

## 🚀 **About the Project**

This repository contains the source code for the **QHub Learning Platform**, developed by the **Innovation Department of Quantum Hub Perú**.

Our goal is to build **open-source quantum education tools** that help democratize QISE (Quantum Information Science & Engineering) in LATAM.

The platform includes four core modules:

1. **Bits → Qubits**
2. **Quantum Phenomena** — superposition, interference, measurement, entanglement
3. **Math for Quantum** — complex numbers, vectors, matrices
4. **Quantum Gates & Circuits** — Bloch sphere, gates, circuit builder

Each concept is reinforced through **experiential learning**, **gamification**, and **interactive visual simulations**, guided by our mascot **Schrödi**.

# 🎮 **Underpinning educational theory**

The platform is grounded in an experiential learning approach, where students construct understanding by directly interacting with quantum systems through visual and dynamic tools. Rather than relying on traditional lecture-style explanations, the platform uses gamification elements—such as drag-and-drop challenges, step-based progress, quizzes, and real-time feedback—to sustain engagement and encourage active discovery. The learning flow follows generative learning principles: students manipulate states, test predictions, observe outcomes, and refine intuition as they progress, reinforcing mental models at each step. By combining interactivity, immediate consequences for user actions, and conceptual scaffolding, the platform ensures that learners build accurate, experience-driven understanding of quantum concepts, even without prior mathematical or physics background.

# 🎯 **Intended Usage & Outcomes**

### **Intended Audience of the Platform**

Our web app is designed for Latin American learners taking their first steps into quantum computing, primarily high school and early college students. During our pilot test, we saw a mix of backgrounds: some users had only studied pre-university math, others had completed linear algebra or introductory programming, and a few came from physics tracks. Because of that range, the platform’s structure focuses on clarity and gradual progression. The interactive components—Bloch sphere tools, circuit builders, matrix-vector visualizations—help level the playing field so that students with different preparation can engage meaningfully with the material. The broader goal is to offer a reliable entry point to quantum science in Spanish, reducing barriers that drastically marginalize students in our region from accessing this field.

Part of the motivation for creating the platform came from our experience running QuantumHub Peru’s flagship course, which is highly technical and academically demanding. Our nationwide admission exam is competitive, and only a small group of students—often those with exceptional mathematical backgrounds or experience in national and international olympiads—could join. This left a much larger group of applicants and followers who were interested in quantum computing but did not have access to a structured way to start learning. With more than 350 applicants and only a small fraction admitted, we felt the need to build a parallel learning path: something rigorous enough to be meaningful, but accessible enough for anyone with curiosity and a willingness to learn. The platform grew out of that idea—to democratize access while keeping the content interactive, compact, and conceptually solid, so that any Hispanic learner can take their first steps in quantum science.

### **Intended Audience of the Demonstration / Video**

The attached short demonstration video ([https://youtu.be/AfuGV5t9_6g](https://youtu.be/AfuGV5t9_6g)) is meant for reviewers and organizations involved in quantum education and outreach, including CQN and Q^3. The purpose of the demo is straightforward: to show how the platform behaves in usage, what students actually learned from it, and which interactive features contributed the most to their understanding. Rather than focusing on promotional language, this pitch highlights the elements that students interacted with most frequently during testing and the specific learning gains we measured in our product’s portfolio. Our hope is that reviewers will evaluate the demo based on those observations—engagement patterns, clarity improvements, and the potential of the platform to scale as a quantum-readiness tool for Spanish-speaking students.
