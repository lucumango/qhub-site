# ⚛️ **QHub Learning Platform — QuantumHub Perú**

**The future is not deterministic — it’s quantum.**

Welcome to the QHub Learning Platform, an interactive learning environment created by QuantumHub Perú to make quantum computing education accessible, visual, and intuitive for students across Peru and Latin America.

The platform is designed for high school learners and early-year university students, enabling them to explore quantum concepts through animations, guided interactions, and hands-on simulations — no prior background required.

## 🚀 **About the Project**

This repository contains the source code for the **QHub Learning Platform**, developed by the **Innovation Department of Quantum Hub Perú**.

Our goal is to build **open-source quantum education tools** that help democratize QISE (Quantum Information Science & Engineering) in LATAM.

The platform includes four core modules:

1. **Bits → Qubits**
2. **Quantum Phenomena** — superposition, interference, measurement, entanglement
3. **Math for Quantum** — complex numbers, vectors, matrices
4. **Quantum Gates & Circuits** — Bloch sphere, gates, circuit builder

Each concept is reinforced through **experiential learning**, **gamification**, and **interactive visual simulations**, guided by our mascot **Schrödi**.

## 🎮 **Underpinning educational theory**

The platform is grounded in an experiential learning approach, where students construct understanding by directly interacting with quantum systems through visual and dynamic tools. Rather than relying on traditional lecture-style explanations, the platform uses gamification elements such as drag-and-drop challenges, step-based progress, quizzes, and real-time feedback—to sustain engagement and encourage active discovery. The learning flow follows generative learning principles: students manipulate states, test predictions, observe outcomes, and refine intuition as they progress, reinforcing mental models at each step. By combining interactivity, immediate consequences for user actions, and conceptual scaffolding, the platform ensures that learners build an accurate, experience-driven understanding of quantum concepts, even without prior mathematical or physics background.

## 🎯 **Intended Usage & Outcomes**

Our web app is designed for Latin American learners taking their first steps into quantum computing, primarily high school and early college students. During our pilot test, we saw a mix of backgrounds: some users had only studied pre-university math, others had completed linear algebra or introductory programming, and a few came from physics tracks. Because of that range, the platform’s structure focuses on clarity and gradual progression. The interactive components—Bloch sphere tools, circuit builders, matrix-vector visualizations—help level the playing field so that students with different preparation can engage meaningfully with the material. The broader goal is to offer a reliable entry point to quantum science in Spanish, reducing barriers that drastically marginalize students in our region from accessing this field.
Part of the motivation for creating the platform came from our experience running QuantumHub Peru’s flagship course, which is highly technical and academically demanding. Our nationwide admission exam is competitive, and only a small group of students—often those with exceptional mathematical backgrounds or experience in national and international olympiads—could join. This left a much larger group of applicants and followers who were interested in quantum computing but did not have access to a structured way to start learning. With more than 350 applicants and only a small fraction admitted, we felt the need to build a parallel learning path: something rigorous enough to be meaningful, but accessible enough for anyone with curiosity and a willingness to learn. The platform grew out of that idea—to democratize access while keeping the content interactive, compact, and conceptually solid, so that any Hispanic learner can take their first steps in quantum science.

### **Intended Audience of the Demonstration / Video**

The attached short demonstration video ([https://youtu.be/AfuGV5t9_6g](https://youtu.be/AfuGV5t9_6g)) is meant for reviewers and organizations involved in quantum education and outreach, including CQN and Q^3. The purpose of the demo is straightforward: to show how the platform behaves in usage, what students actually learned from it, and which interactive features contributed the most to their understanding. Rather than focusing on promotional language, this pitch highlights the elements that students interacted with most frequently during testing and the specific learning gains we measured in our product’s portfolio. Our hope is that reviewers will evaluate the demo based on those observations—engagement patterns, clarity improvements, and the potential of the platform to scale as a quantum-readiness tool for Spanish-speaking students.

## 💰 **Budget & Budget Justification**

If awarded, the $10,000 prize would be directed entirely toward the growth and professionalization of QuantumHub as a nonprofit ecosystem committed to expanding access to quantum education and research in Latin America. The work we have done so far—including the development of the QHub Learning Platform and the delivery of our highly technical flagship course—has been carried out on a volunteer basis. Strengthening our departments with targeted financial support would allow us to scale responsibly and sustain the impact we have already seen.

A first priority is the Academic Department, where we shape our future human capital (instructors and researchers) and all of our instructional work is concentrated. Our long-term goal is to expand the core curriculum by adding new courses that include topics such as Quantum Optimization or Quantum Machine Learning. Until now, our instructors have included some of the most recognized Hispanic emerging talents, but all of them contribute their time voluntarily. Funding would allow us to invite additional qualified educators—international doctoral students or researchers with experience in these areas—and to compensate them in a modest but meaningful way that aligns with our nonprofit model. This investment would directly improve the quality of our flagship course offering while maintaining the rigorous standards that define QuantumHub Peru.

Our Research Department would also benefit from these funds. Beyond publishing our current studies on quantum readiness and quantum education in Latin America, we aim to incorporate technically oriented projects where students will now work on real-world applications, such as quantum approaches to environmental impact mitigation or transportation optimization in Peru. To make this feasible, we will rely on mentors with extensive expertise. Any compensation would be symbolic relative to industry rates but critical for attracting experienced contributors willing to guide students on these topics.

On the technical side, the Innovation Department will continue developing the QHub Learning Platform. The prototype we’ve built for the QREATE Challenge has strong foundations, but scaling it requires additional engineering time, UX improvements, new simulation assets, and robust testing infrastructure. Supporting this work ensures that the platform remains a sustainable gateway for thousands of students who do not enter our flagship program but still seek a structured path into quantum science in Spanish.

Finally, part of the funding would also support the Community and Public Relations Departments, which are responsible for outreach and scientific engagement. Next year, we hope to organize the first 100% in-person Qiskit Fall Fest conference in Peru, which involves venue rental, logistics, and operational costs. These events are key to building a local community and highlighting our presence in Latin America around quantum tech. We also maintain steady outreach through social media and public programming, which carries recurring expenses such as domains and communication tools. These costs are modest individually but add up over time and are essential to sustaining the presence that has allowed QuantumHub to inspire over a thousand followers and learners so far.
